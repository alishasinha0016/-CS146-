In this program, I have applied the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities. 

First, the function validity() checks if all the given constraints are met. I have used HashSet<> to check the duplicate pairs and for loops to varify other validity constraints. In case any one of the conditions are not met, the function returns false otherwise true.

The findTheCity() takes number of cities (n), edges (a 2D array that contains (from, to, weight) arrays), and distancethreshold. The function then calls the validity() function. If it returns true, it proceeds further otherwise it returns "null" (in Java) or "None" (in python) to the calling main function. A double dimantional array is created, cityDistance[][]. The diagonal elements (i.e., distances[i][i]) are set to 0 to represent the distance from a city to itself. Other elements are initialized to -1 to indicate that the distance between two cities is unknown or unreachable. Using a for loop, weights that represents distance between fromCity to toCity are added in cityDistance[][] at respective indices.
Later, Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities. It uses three nested for loop where k is the outermost loop variable, i is the inner variable and j is the innermost loop variavle. It iteratively updates the distances by considering each intermediate city k.

In the end, nested for loop is used to iterate over each city i and count the number of reachable cities within the given distance threshold. In case the current city has fewer reachable cities than the previous minimum, the minimum reachable cities and the corresponding city index is then updated.
The city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the distance threshold is then returned to the calling main function.

The main function passes the required arguments to the findTheCity() function and based on the returned value, approproate message or output is printed.

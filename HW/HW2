/*
In this program, it was mentioend that we have been given an API bool isBadVersion(version) 
which returns whether version is bad. In this program we have to Implement a function to find the bad version. 
Here I have used left, right, and mid integer variavles that stores the index value of the element 
in a data structure like array. The size of the array is 'n' whihc is passed as parameter to this function. 
I have applied binary serach ligic where I am breaking teh data structure, like an array, into smaller 
parts by eleminating elemnts and geting to the currect element.
In te end, the function again checks if the resultant index has bad version. If yes, it returns 
the index value otherwise it returns -1 in case there was no bad version pressent.

class BadVersion{
    public int checkBadVersion(int n){
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(left < right){
            mid = (left+right)/2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)){
                right = mid;
            }
            else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        // checking by calling API bool isBadVersion()if there really exists a bad version
        if (isBadVersion(left))
            return left;
        //if there is no bad version, then  it will return -1   
        else
            return -1;
    }

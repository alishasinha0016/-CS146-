In this program the priority function where the arrays are arranged based on their start time (ptiority) and if there is any clash or overlap between start time and end time (of the previous row)then we move forward to the next row. Otherwise, we increment the count variable that represents the availibility of the rooms. 

In the function we first check if the length of the passed double dimentional array and the start and end times in the array are within the given limit. Then the double dimantional array that contains the start and end time pair is sorted in asceding order by passing it to another function, sortByStartTime(). The sortByStartTime() uses the selection sort technique to arrange the 2D array based on start time (which is the priority) and then it is returned to the priority() function. An endTimes[] array is also creatd and sorted which contains all the end time from the interval[][] array so that we can then compare the start and end times to count the total number of room avaialble.
Later, a for loop is used that checks and counts based on wheather the start and end time overlaps and counts the available room. The count variable is then returned to the main function.

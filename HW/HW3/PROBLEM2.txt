Given Problem:

      MATRIX_MULTIPLY(A, B): 
c1      if columns(A) ≠ rows(B): 
c2        raise ValueError("Matrix multiplication is not defined.") 
    
c3      rows_A ← number of rows in A 
c4      cols_A ← number of columns in A 
c5      cols_B ← number of columns in B 
c6      result ← matrix of size rows_A x cols_B filled with zeros 
    
rows_A  for i from 1 to rows_A do: 
cols_B    for j from 1 to cols_B do: 
c7        sum ← 0 
cols_A      for k from 1 to cols_A do: 
c8            sum ← sum + A[i][k] * B[k][j] 
c9          result[i][j] ← sum return result



Since we have a nested loop with two loops inside an outer loop. Hence, the time complexity of the nested loop is O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A)

Total Time complexity = O(c1) + O(c2) + O(c3) + O(c4) + O(c5) + O(c6) + O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A)
We can ignore the constants at this time and get;
Total Time complexity = O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A)

Best Case: The best case could be when we have a small matrix. Even then, because the element multiplication and addition are required, the time complexity will remain the same: O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A).

Worst Case: The worst case scenario can occur when we have a significantly large matrix size to multiply. However, since the necessary multiplication and addition of the elements will take place, the time complexity will remain the same: O (rows_A*cols_B*cols_A).

Average Case: In cases where the matrix is not very big, it would be an average case. Again, because the necessary multiplication and addition of the elements will take place, the time complexity will remain the same: O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A).

Also, if we have square matrices of size 'n,' then the time complexity will be O(rows_A*cols_B*cols_A) = O(n^3).

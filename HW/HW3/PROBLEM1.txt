Psuedo code for insertion sort:

 c1     int n = arr.length;
 c2     int p = 0;
 N      for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) 
 -       {
 c3         int p = arr[i];
 c4         int j = i - 1;
 
            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
               greater than key, to one position ahead
               of their current position */
  N^2        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > p) {
  c5            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
  c6            j = j - 1;
  -         }
  c7        arr[j + 1] = p;
  -     }

Time Complexity: O(c1) + O(c1) +O(c2) +O(N) +O(c3) +O(c4) +O(N^2) +O(c5) +O(c6) + O(c7)
Ignoring the constants and lower power, we get,
Time Complexity = O(N^2)

First, insertion sort is a sorting algorithm in which we compare the element 
in a given array to its previous element in the same array. This comparison is made based on 
what kind of order we want, ascending or descending. If we want the array in ascending order,
then while comparing, we will check if the current element is smaller than its previous element.
If it is smaller, the previous element will be moved to the current element's position, and the current element 
will be moved to the previous element's position. This process will continue till we get the final array sorted in 
ascending order.

Let's analyze the time complexity of insertion sort:

Best Case: The best case would be if the given array is already in ascending or descending order (sorted as required).
In this scenario, the elements will be compared with their respective previous elements. Since the array is sorted, 
no swapping of the elements will take place. 
Hence, Time Complexity: O(N)

Worst Case: The worst case would be if the array is sorted in the reverse order (to what is expected or required).
Here, because it is in the reverse order, each element will be compared to its previous element and swapped. This continues until
the beginning of the loop is reached. This happens each time for each element in the array.
Hence, Time Complexity: O(N^2)

Average Care: The average case will be where the elements in the array are mixed, that is, niether already sorted nor reverse sorted.
Here, the loops will run, and elements will be swapped on a case by case basis.
Hence, Time Complexity: O(N^2)

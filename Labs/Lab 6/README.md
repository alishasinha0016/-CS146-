In this program, DFS algorithm is used to find if the cources were repeated, that is, if there is a cyle that exist. Here, a course graph is created using an adjacency Matrix. We mark the course number as 'True' if it is a prerequisite of the other course. Then, after creating the matrix, we check if the required course is not repeated calling another function, checkRepatCource(). This functions uses DFS (Depath For Search) to check if there is a cycle in the graph using recurssion. If we find that a course bi that is a prerequisite of ai course and ai is also a prerequisite for bi. That means, a cycle exist. We return false if a cycle exist and true otherwise.
